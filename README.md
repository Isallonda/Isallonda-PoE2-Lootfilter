# Loot Filter - for Path of Exile 2


Welcome to Isallonda's Lootfilter!

This filter is designed for general mapping. You can change or delete any special categories you donâ€™t need. 
The "special shows" are set for my Deadeye build with Dualstring Bow and Visceral Quiver, plus valuable white items like Headhunter or Atramentis.

#======================================

To hide something, just change Show to Hide (capitalize the H).

Yellow items are only shown as Expert bases. 
Magic items are only shown for jewelry, mage wands, scepters, etc. 
You can adjust the gold amount by changing both numbers in the filter.

Colors are based on RGB values. Google an RGB picker to adjust colors to your liking.

To remove beams or map icons, delete the "PlayEffect" or "minimapicon" sections.

Waystones are shown from tier 10 upwards. If you want to show them at lower tiers, just change "Hide" to "Show" for levels you want to be shown.

#===========================================

Need help or want to give feedback? DM me in POE2: Isallonda#6132.

Thanks for using my filter!  May your loot be plentiful, your map runs smooth, and your adventures full of sparkles. Stay sane Exiles! <3
